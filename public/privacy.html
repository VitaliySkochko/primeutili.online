  <h2>14. Data Security and Protection</h2>
<p>
  We take the protection of your data, especially sensitive Google user
  data, very seriously. We implement the following data protection
  mechanisms to keep your information safe:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All communication between the
    Pure Cleaner app and Google's servers is encrypted using
    industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data at Rest:</strong> We do not permanently store your email
    content, email bodies, or attachments on our servers. When you use
    the email cleaning feature, metadata (like sender and date) is
    processed in real-time and is not stored after your session is
    complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited Use:</strong> We strictly adhere to the Google API
    Services User Data Policy's Limited Use requirements. Your Gmail
    data is <strong>only</strong> used to provide the email cleaning
    feature as described. It is never used for advertising, sold to
    third parties, or analyzed by humans, except as required for
    security purposes or legal compliance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access Control:</strong> We use secure OAuth 2.0
    authentication tokens to access your data. You can revoke this
    access at any time via your Google Account security settings.
    Access to any user data on our backend systems is strictly limited
    to authorized personnel for the sole purpose of maintaining and
    securing the service.
  </li>
</ul>
